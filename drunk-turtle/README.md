# Drunk Turtle

Turtle's are notorious drinkers, from pirate rum to pretty much anything else they can get their hands on. In an effort to reign in turtle DUIs a task force has been assembled to analyze turtle crawling behavior. Lucky for you, you've been assigned to the task force as its lead engineer.

Using the marvels of modern technology the Tiny Turtle Task force (TTT) has managed to encode turtle movements in a similar syntax as the familiar "Logo" programming language. The "language" is remarkably simple and has the following constructs:

RIGHT [integer] - Turtle moves right
LEFT [integer] - Turtle moves left
UP [integer] - Turtle moves up
DOWN [integer] - Turtle moves down

The TTT has asked you to develop a program that given an input file of moves can output the following:
* What's the longest single line the turtle travels?
* How large of a rectangle would be needed to contain the turtle's movements?
* Does the turtle "cross over" a path that it's already traveled?
* Generate the shortest (sober) path for the turtle's path
